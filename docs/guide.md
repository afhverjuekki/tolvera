# Guide

This guide provides an overview of the Tölvera v0.1.0 API:

- For specific methods available in each area, see [Reference](/reference/tolvera/context).
- More code examples are available [here](https://github.com/Intelligent-Instruments-Lab/iil-examples/tree/main/tolvera).

The v0.2.0 API will be different, so everything here is subject to change.

## Program Structure

This example demonstrates the basic usage of Tölvera when used as a standalone Python script. 
It will display a window with a black background:

```py
from tolvera import Tolvera, run

def main(**kwargs):
  tv = Tolvera(**kwargs)

  @tv.render
  def _():
      return tv.px

if __name__ == '__main__':
  run(main)
```

- First, we import the `Tolvera` class and `run()` function from the `tolvera` Python package.
- Then, a `def main()` function takes in keyword arguments (`**kwargs`) from the command line.
- Inside `def main()`, we initialise a `Tolvera` instance with the given `**kwargs`.
- We use the `@tv.render()` decorator to create the scene and render the pixels.
- This function can be named anything (`def _()` in the example), and is analagous to `loop()` in Arduino/Processing/p5.js and `render()` in Bela, in that it will run in a loop until the user exits the program.
- However, `def _()` must return an instance of `Pixels`. 
- Often, these pixels will be the `Pixels` instance belonging to the `Tolvera` instance, accessed with `tv.px`.
- Finally, we call `run()` with `def main()` as the argument.

## Particles (`tv.p`) & Species (`tv.s.species`)

A central idea of Tölvera is the particle as a base unit of activity.
The particle system is a field of type `Particle` with these properties:

```py
@ti.dataclass
class Particle:
  species: ti.i32
  active: ti.f32
  pos: ti.math.vec2
  vel: ti.math.vec2
  mass: ti.f32
  size: ti.f32
  speed: ti.f32
```

Particles are divided into species (represented as an integer), and species can have different relationships with each other, creating a matrix of species-species interactions.
This idea was inspired by [Particle Life](https://particle-life.com/), and provides a simple means to mimic ecological complexity, even when using a single behaviour.
Species are implemented as multi-dimensional state, which means all `tv.v` behaviour models can make use of the multispecies matrix.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Species](../assets/images/species.jpg)
  <figcaption>Multi-species matrix (`tv.s.species`) with N species shown on each axis, with example shown based on `tv.v.flock()`’s rules. Every species has a different relationship with each other, including itself, i.e. cell (0,0) shows the 0th species’ relationship with itself. As species are implemented as state (`tv.s`), OSC endpoints can be automatically created allowing for dynamically updating rules of individual species pairs, or groups of pairs, or indeed the entire set of rules.</figcaption>
</figure>

## State (`tv.s`)

To enable composition of behaviours, Tölvera features a global state dictionary.
State is n-dimensional and can be manipulated in parallel on the GPU.
Typical state shapes might be: `(species, species)` for multispecies rules, `(particles)` for individual particle states, and \pyi(particles, particles) for pairwise comparison of particles.
Assigning a dictionary to a variable after `tv.s` causes a new state to be instanced.
Here are two examples of state from `tv.v.flock`, showing the syntax of `"name": (type, min, max)` for each attribute, and some of the additional options which includes built-in randomisation:

```py
tv.s.flock_s = { "state": 
  {
    "separate": (ti.f32, 0.01, 1.0),
    "align": (ti.f32, 0.01, 1.0),
    "cohere": (ti.f32, 0.01, 1.0),
    "radius": (ti.f32, 0.01, 1.0),
  },
  "shape": (species, species),
  "osc": ("set"),
  "randomise": True
}

tv.s.flock_dist = {
  "state": {"dist": (ti.f32, 0.0, tv.x*2)},
  "shape": (particles, particles),
  "randomise": False
}
```

State is useful and interesting to visualise, for example drawing the particle distances that `flock` uses reveals hidden structure.
State can also be reused and combined with state from other models, to compose even more complex behaviour.

## Vera (`tv.v`)

The image below shows some of the available behaviours and models in Tölvera.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Species](../assets/images/vera.jpg)
  <figcaption>Examples of behaviours and models available via `tv.v`. Top row: stateless `tv.v`. Bottom row: stateful `tv.v`.</figcaption>
</figure>

Models can be used by calling them and passing particles to them, for example:

```py
@tv.render
def _():
  tv.px.clear()
  tv.v.flock(tv.p)
  tv.v.plife(tv.p)
  tv.px.particles(tv.p, tv.s.species())
  return tv.px
```

In this case, the `flock` and `plife` (particle life) models are composed together to create a compound behaviour.
Models are also designed to be simple and concise internally to encourage users to understand them and make their own.
Simple behaviours like `move` can be stateless and implemented as single GPU kernels.

```py
@ti.kernel
def move(p: ti.template()):
  for i in range(p.field.shape[0]):
    p1 = p.field[i]
    if p1.field[i].active == 0: continue
    p.field[i].pos += p1.vel * p1.speed
```

Models that use state are implemented as classes, that at minimum provide a `step()` method, where particles can be compared and states updated:

```py
@ti.data_oriented
class MyVera:
  def __init__(self, tolvera, **kwargs):
    self.tv, self.kwargs = tolvera, kwargs
    self.C = CONSTS({...})
    self.tv.s.vera_s = {...} # state

  @ti.kernel
  def step(self, p):
    for i in range(p.shape[0]):
      for j in range(p.shape[1]):
        # compare p[i] & p[j]
        # update state, etc.
      p[i].pos += ... # update p[i]

  def __call__(self, p):
    self.step(p)
```

Step function inside `tv.v`:
```py
@ti.kernel
def step(self, p: ti.template(), W: ti.f32):
  for i in range(p.shape[0]):
    p1 = p[i]
    if p1[i].active == 0: continue
    for j in range(p.shape[0]):
      p2 = p[j]
      if i == j & p2[j].active == 0: continue
      s = self.tv.s.vera_s[p1.species, p2.species]
      d = p1.pos - p2.pos
      if d < s.radius:
        # p1 & p2 are neighbours
    p[i].vel += W * ...
    p[i].pos += W * ...
```

## Pixels (`tv.px`)

Tölvera has a drawing module that is similar in design to p5.js.
This example draws a rectangle in the middle of the window:

```py
import taichi as ti
from tolvera import Tolvera, run

def main(**kwargs):
    tv = Tolvera(**kwargs)

    @ti.kernel
    def draw():
        w = 100
        tv.px.rect(tv.x/2-w/2, tv.y/2-w/2, w, w, ti.Vector([1., 0., 0., 1.]))

    @tv.render
    def _():
        draw()
        return tv.px

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run(main)
```


It mainly features shape primitives and blend modes.
Pixels can also be thought of as fields and used as part of a _vera_, as `tv.v.slime` does to [deposit particles onto a pheromone trail](https://cargocollective.com/sagejenson/physarum).
Due to this flexibility, drawing and visualisation can impact behaviour and create more mappings and feedback loops between model states.

## GPU Programming (`tv.ti`)

Tölvera does most of its work on the GPU thanks to [Taichi](https://taichi-lang.org/) (`tv.ti`).
Taichi is a domain-specific language (DSL) embedded in Python that supports multiple backends (CUDA, OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal).
Taichi programs are distinguished by three levels of scope: regular Python scope, kernel scope (`@ti.kernel`) and function scope (`@ti.func`).
Python scope can call kernels, and kernels and functions can call functions.
In Taichi scope, top-level `for` loops are automatically parallelised.
It can also run headless (without a window), and provides a C runtime and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation for deployment in non-Python programs.
[It also interoperates with NumPy and PyTorch](https://docs.taichi-lang.org/docs/external) for ML integrations.

## Open Sound Control (`tv.osc`)

OSC in Tölvera is handled by [`iipyper`](https://intelligent-instruments-lab.github.io/iipyper/), a package specifically designed for working with artificial intelligence.
When creating state, OSC endpoints can be automatically added via the `"osc"` option.
For custom OSC endpoints, the `tv.osc.map` decorators can be used to add senders and receivers of different varieties.
Here are two examples, one of receiving two arguments `x` and `y`, and another of receiving a vector of length ten:

```py
@tv.osc.map.receive_args(x=(0.,0.,1.), y=(0.,0.,1.), count=5)
def my_args(x: float, y: float):
  print(f"Receiving args: {x} {y}")

@tv.osc.map.receive_list(vector=(0.,0.,1.), length=10, count=5)
def my_list(vector: list[float]):
  print(f"Received list: {vector}")
```

The `count` decorator argument can be used to rate limit how often an endpoint's Python function runs, relative to the number of frames elapsing.
Tölvera OSC mappings can be exported to JSON and XML, and they can also generate patches for Max/MSP and Pure Data, enabling rapid integration with other software.

  <figcaption>Open Sound Control map (`tv.osc.map`) client generated by Tölvera for Pure Data (Pd) based on the code example above.<figcaption>
</figure>

<!-- % Live coding TidalCycles API example - anything with OSC API can integrate -->

## Interactive Machine Learning (`tv.iml`)

Interactive machine learning is achieved via the [`anguilla`](https://intelligent-instruments-lab.github.io/anguilla/) Python package.
Tölvera features a global dictionary of IML instances at `tv.iml`, similarly to state (`tv.s`).
IML can be used for a wide range of purposes in Tölvera, including creating internal feedback loops, for example between `tv.v.flock`'s position and species rules states:

```py
tv.iml.flock_p2flock_s = {
  'type': 'fun2fun', 
  'size': (tv.s.flock_p.size, tv.s.flock_s.size), 
  'io': (tv.s.flock_p.to_vec, tv.s.flock_s.from_vec)
}
```

The above example uses `fun2fun`, meaning the input and output methods specified in the `io` option will be run in the background by Tölvera.
These are `to_vec` and `from_vec`, built-in methods that serialise and deserialise state to/from 1D arrays making them suitable for use as IML input/output vectors.
To facilitate automatic routing of IML inputs and outputs, there are nine types in which the input and output can be either a vector, function or OSC endpoint: 
`vec2vec`, 
`vec2fun`, 
`vec2osc`, 
`fun2vec`, 
`fun2fun`, 
`fun2osc`, 
`osc2vec`, 
`osc2fun`, 
and `osc2osc`.
Notably, these IML maps can be trained and updated on-the-fly, providing more variation in prolonged usage.

The image below demonstrates how Tölvera's state and drawing capabilities can be used to enable real-time visualisation of IML mappings.
